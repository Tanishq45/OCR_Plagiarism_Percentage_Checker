Summary:
The Controls Recovery utit wil enable Control dealers and installers to minimize the
time, paperwork, inconvenience, and other costs associated with devices that fail during the
update proces or at some other time, I wil quickly become a valuable tol in your
Control arsenal

(Occasionally, and most likely during an update process, a Contrld device wil become
inoperable. At this point the Dealer / Installer cals Tech Support and troubleshoot the
evice. if unable to restore the device using Tenet or other measures indicated by Tech
Support, an RMA will be issued. An RMA is inconvenient and costly both for Controld and
forthe Dealer / Installer due to increased time on the ob, shipping charges, anda probable
return trip to the customer site

‘Most ofthe devices which are retumed via RMA canbe restored to a fully functional
condition. In order to enable Tech Support and the Dealer / Installer to have the ability to
‘estore devices inthe field, Control has developed the Controlé Recovery utity. Now, ia
device doesn't update correctly or in some other way becomes inoperable, the Dealer |
Installer can recover that device immediately. This reduces the time, expense, and
inconvenience for both partes incurred through the RMA process,
