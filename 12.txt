Technical Research Paper
“Microcontroller based Fault Detector”

GENERAL Abstract

Purpose: The aim of this research is to develop a device used to detect faults in the
line and isolate the connected system or instrument connected to it

Seope: This device involves the use of microcontroller for detection and isolation of
the system of instrument with proper use of programming. The instrument devised is
economical and effective compared to other protective devices available in market,
‘After the patent of the product « large scale production is also possible for consumer
Design Approach: The design methodology involves the use of microcontroller in
conjugation with the relay circuitry with display on a LCD screen. It isa totally new
design in the market and it will bea substitute to ELCB’s, MCB’s and Relays in near
future

 

 

Practical Implications: The circuit devised can be used in conjugation with the
‘medical instrument, industrial instrument and even in the household application. It finds
«alot of applications in factories and industries where costly instruments are to be saved
from faults.

Conclusion: ‘The device thus developed is very economical and effective in the use of
protection in household as well as industrial instrument protection, The added
advantage of this circuit is that it shows the type of fault occurred on LCD and at the
same time keeps the circuit in isolation until the fault is cleared.

INTRODUCTION

> A faut in electrical equipment is defined as a defect in its electrical circuit due to
‘which the current is diverted from the intended path,

> Faults are generally caused by mechanical failure, accidents, excessive internal and
extemal stresses ete

> The fault impedance being low, the fault currents are relatively high. During the faults,
the power flow is diverted towards the fault and the supply to the neighboring zone is,
affected. Voltages become unbalanced.
